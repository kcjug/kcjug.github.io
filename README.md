# Developer Notes

This site was built using a site template framework, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). Gatsby requires an installation of [Node.js and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). To get started with Gatsby, the [Gatsby quick-start guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/) will give a great introduction for how to installing Gatsby and run the site locally in development mode.

Once Gatsby is installed, navigate to the base directory of the project. From that directory, the site can be generated and opened in the default web browser with:
```bash
gatsby develop -o
```

After the page is opened, changes to the source will be reflected in the opened site.
