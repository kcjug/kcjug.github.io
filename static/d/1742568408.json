Come hear about how this technique has been applied in real-life applications right here in the KC area. Writing JUnit tests may be part of your everyday life already, but find out how using a more descriptive language and an open-source tool like Cucumber can enhance the quality and maintainability of your Java applications.</p> <p>About the Speaker:<br/>Keith Shakib has been a principal consultant in Kansas City since 2000 and has been with Keyhole Software since 2011.
