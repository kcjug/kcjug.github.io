{{< text-section title="We have a passion for all things Java™">}}
Whether you are a dedicated professional or a coding hobbyist, novice developer or seasoned
engineer, programming student or lifelong learner, the Kansas City JUG is dedicated to bringing
content to the community about all things on the JVM.

If you're curious about [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), juiced
about [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/), stoked
about [Spring](https://spring.io/), or anything in between, our meetups span a
variety of topics related to Java™ and other JVM-based technologies.

We feature speakers from the local community as well as internationally renowned speakers,
authors, and industry leaders.

In addition to the informative topics, Kansas City JUG meetups give our members the opportunity
to network with other developers and our great sponsors! Our other platforms facilitate
interaction among our members. Feel free to dive in and share a topic, ask a question, find
employment opportunities, or just socialize!

{{< text-section title="Meetups">}}
Kansas City JUG hosts meetups on a monthly basis. Our typical meetups are on the 3rd
Wendesday of the month. Occasionally, we host meetups on different days to accomodate
speaker travel dates or avoid collision with other events (such as US holidays). To view
and RSVP for upcoming events, please see our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/KansasCityJUG/).
