[{"categories":null,"contents":" Kansas City Java User Group Get involved We encourage the Kansas City JUG community to get involved! There are several outlets which community members can use to interact with the rest of the community. Check us out below! We have a passion for all things Java™ Whether you are a dedicated professional or a coding hobbyist, novice developer or seasoned engineer, programming student or lifelong learner, the Kansas City JUG is dedicated to bringing content to the community about all things on the JVM.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about Kotlin, juiced about Jakarta EE, stoked about Spring, or anything in between, our meetups span a variety of topics related to Java™ and other JVM-based technologies.\nWe feature speakers from the local community as well as internationally renowned speakers, authors, and industry leaders.\nIn addition to the informative topics, Kansas City JUG meetups give our members the opportunity to network with other developers and our great sponsors! Our other platforms facilitate interaction among our members. Feel free to dive in and share a topic, ask a question, find employment opportunities, or just socialize!\nMeetups Kansas City JUG hosts meetups on a monthly basis. Our typical meetups are on the 3rd Wendesday of the month. Occasionally, we host meetups on different days to accomodate speaker travel dates or avoid collision with other events (such as US holidays). To view and RSVP for upcoming events, please see our Meetup page.\nUpcoming KCJUG Annual Lightning Round Meetup Hey KCJUG Members, Our October meeting is our annual gathering for hosting lightning talks.\nLightning talks are short 5-15 minute talks. We do this annually as an opportunity for our members to try out public speaking, without having to go through the effort of putting together a full 60 minute talk. Which can be quite daunting.\nIf you are interested in presenting, please submit your talk at this link https://sessionize.com/kansas-city-java-users-group/.\nSchedule: TBD!\nThank you to TEKSystems for sponsoring!\nLearn more Feedback Since we\u0026rsquo;re always looking for feedback, take a few minutes and let us know what you think!\nCan the schedule better accomodate you? What things will bring you out to KC JUG? Should we host workshops? We welcome all other feedback as well. Let us know what\u0026rsquo;s on your mind!\nSponsoring We rely on sponsorship efforts for bringing speakers to Kansas City and assistance in facilitating a welcoming atmosphere atmosphere for our members. In exchange for sponsorship, our sponsors have the opportunity to join in the networking and social interaction with the members in attendance, as well as receive recognition for their sponsorship.
