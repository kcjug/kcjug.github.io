[{"categories":null,"contents":" Kansas City Java User Group Get involved We encourage the Kansas City JUG community to get involved! There are several outlets which community members can use to interact with the rest of the community. Check us out below! We have a passion for all things Java™ Whether you are a dedicated professional or a coding hobbyist, novice developer or seasoned engineer, programming student or lifelong learner, the Kansas City JUG is dedicated to bringing content to the community about all things on the JVM.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about Kotlin, juiced about Jakarta EE, stoked about Spring, or anything in between, our meetups span a variety of topics related to Java™ and other JVM-based technologies.\nWe feature speakers from the local community as well as internationally renowned speakers, authors, and industry leaders.\nIn addition to the informative topics, Kansas City JUG meetups give our members the opportunity to network with other developers and our great sponsors! Our other platforms facilitate interaction among our members. Feel free to dive in and share a topic, ask a question, find employment opportunities, or just socialize!\nMeetups Kansas City JUG hosts meetups on a monthly basis. Our typical meetups are on the 3rd Wendesday of the month. Occasionally, we host meetups on different days to accomodate speaker travel dates or avoid collision with other events (such as US holidays). To view and RSVP for upcoming events, please see our Meetup page.\nUpcoming Securing Spring AI: Enterprise-Grade Chatbot Integration for SaaS Platforms Modern SaaS platforms increasingly require AI-driven features, but direct API integration can introduce serious security vulnerabilities and scalability challenges. This presentation demonstrates how to design and deploy a production-ready Spring AI chatbot with enterprise-grade security using Spring Gateway, OAuth2, and a microservices-based architecture. Through live demonstrations, we’ll contrast insecure direct API access with a properly secured implementation. You’ll see how to integrate Spring AI with both local (Ollama) and cloud-based (Azure OpenAI) providers while adhering to zero-trust security principles. Key security practices covered include OAuth2 + JWT authentication, rate limiting, CORS protection for secure embedding, and audit logging—all critical for SaaS integration.\nParticipants will leave with practical knowledge of Spring Gateway design patterns, dynamic AI provider configuration, secure cross-origin embedding techniques, and production-ready monitoring strategies. This session is ideal for Java developers seeking to enhance existing SaaS platforms with AI capabilities without compromising on security or performance.\nTechnologies: Spring AI, Spring Gateway, Spring Security, OAuth2, Ollama, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL\nAbout The Presenter Phillip Hodges brings a unique perspective to software engineering, blending 14 years of computer science education with over 3 years of enterprise software development.
