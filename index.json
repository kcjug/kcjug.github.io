There are several outlets which community members can use to interact with the rest of the community. Check us out below! We have a passion for all things Java™ Whether you are a dedicated professional or a coding hobbyist, novice developer or seasoned engineer, programming student or lifelong learner, the Kansas City JUG is dedicated to bringing content to the community about all things on the JVM.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about Kotlin, juiced about Jakarta EE, stoked about Spring, or anything in between, our meetups span a variety of topics related to Java™ and other JVM-based technologies.\nWe feature speakers from the local community as well as internationally renowned speakers, authors, and industry leaders.\nIn addition to the informative topics, Kansas City JUG meetups give our members the opportunity to network with other developers and our great sponsors! Our other platforms facilitate interaction among our members. Feel free to dive in and share a topic, ask a question, find employment opportunities, or just socialize!\nMeetups Kansas City JUG hosts meetups on a monthly basis. Our typical meetups are on the 3rd Wendesday of the month. Occasionally, we host meetups on different days to accomodate speaker travel dates or avoid collision with other events (such as US holidays). To view and RSVP for upcoming events, please see our Meetup page.\nUpcoming Know Your Java with Venkat Subramaniam Many of us have significant experience in Java. Yet, from time to time, we get tripped up by some code that we quite did not expect to behave the way it does. In this presentation we will take a look at some of those and get a deeper understanding of the language we use everyday. In this highly interactive session, be ready to answer some questions, discuss some code behavior, and gain some in depth knowledge of the nuances in Java. About the Speaker: Dr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has mentored tens of thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.\nAgenda: 5:30-6:15 pm Meet, greet \u0026amp; eat! 6:15-6:20 pm Java News 6:20pm Main presentation After presentation - social hour: Austins Bar \u0026amp; Grill | South Olathe 2103 E 151st St #2969, Olathe, KS 66062\nLearn more Feedback Since we\u0026rsquo;re always looking for feedback, take a few minutes and let us know what you think!\nCan the schedule better accomodate you?
