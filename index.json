[{"categories":null,"contents":" Kansas City Java User Group Get involved We encourage the Kansas City JUG community to get involved! There are several outlets which community members can use to interact with the rest of the community. Check us out below! We have a passion for all things Java™ Whether you are a dedicated professional or a coding hobbyist, novice developer or seasoned engineer, programming student or lifelong learner, the Kansas City JUG is dedicated to bringing content to the community about all things on the JVM.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about Kotlin, juiced about Jakarta EE, stoked about Spring, or anything in between, our meetups span a variety of topics related to Java™ and other JVM-based technologies.\nWe feature speakers from the local community as well as internationally renowned speakers, authors, and industry leaders.\nIn addition to the informative topics, Kansas City JUG meetups give our members the opportunity to network with other developers and our great sponsors! Our other platforms facilitate interaction among our members. Feel free to dive in and share a topic, ask a question, find employment opportunities, or just socialize!\nMeetups Kansas City JUG hosts meetups on a monthly basis. Our typical meetups are on the 3rd Wendesday of the month. Occasionally, we host meetups on different days to accomodate speaker travel dates or avoid collision with other events (such as US holidays). To view and RSVP for upcoming events, please see our Meetup page.\nUpcoming Simpler Java Build Tools with Object Oriented Programming **Abstract:** The Java language is known to be performant, easy to use, and with great IDE support, but Java build tools like Maven or Gradle do not always live up to that reputation. This talk will explore why build tooling is fundamentally such a difficult domain to work in, and how common concepts from object-oriented programming have the potential to simplify the build tool experience. We will end with a demonstration of an experimental new Java build tool \"Mill\" that makes use of these ideas, proving out the idea that Java build tooling has the potential to be much faster, safer, and easier than it is today. Speaker: Haoyi Li graduated from MIT, has built infrastructure for high-growth companies like Dropbox and Databricks, and has been a major contributor to the open source community with over 10,000 stars on Github. Haoyi has deep experience in the JVM and has used it professionally to build cloud infrastructure, distributed backend systems, programming languages, high-performance web applications, and much more.\nThank you to TEKSystems for sponsoring!\nAgenda: 5:30-6:15 pm Meet, greet \u0026amp; eat! 6:15-6:20 pm Java News 6:20pm Main presentation After presentation - social hour: Austins Bar \u0026amp; Grill | South Olathe 2103 E 151st St #2969, Olathe, KS 66062\nLearn more Feedback Since we\u0026rsquo;re always looking for feedback, take a few minutes and let us know what you think!\nCan the schedule better accomodate you?
