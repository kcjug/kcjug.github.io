[{"categories":null,"contents":" Kansas City Java User Group Get involved We encourage the Kansas City JUG community to get involved! There are several outlets which community members can use to interact with the rest of the community. Check us out below! We have a passion for all things Java™ Whether you are a dedicated professional or a coding hobbyist, novice developer or seasoned engineer, programming student or lifelong learner, the Kansas City JUG is dedicated to bringing content to the community about all things on the JVM.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about Kotlin, juiced about Jakarta EE, stoked about Spring, or anything in between, our meetups span a variety of topics related to Java™ and other JVM-based technologies.\nWe feature speakers from the local community as well as internationally renowned speakers, authors, and industry leaders.\nIn addition to the informative topics, Kansas City JUG meetups give our members the opportunity to network with other developers and our great sponsors! Our other platforms facilitate interaction among our members. Feel free to dive in and share a topic, ask a question, find employment opportunities, or just socialize!\nMeetups Kansas City JUG hosts meetups on a monthly basis. Our typical meetups are on the 3rd Wendesday of the month. Occasionally, we host meetups on different days to accomodate speaker travel dates or avoid collision with other events (such as US holidays). To view and RSVP for upcoming events, please see our Meetup page.\nUpcoming Open Source Software And You Open Source Software (OSS) has been part of our industry for decades. It is so ubiquitous that in certain domains it is practically impossible to develop systems without using OSS. You probably use OSS every day and often may not even think about it. Taking a more active role in OSS can help you be more productive and can help others do the same. This involvement doesn’t have to mean quitting your day job and spending most of your time contributing OSS software to the community (though you can, and it can be an awesome experience). Your involvement can be minimal or can be the primary focus of your development efforts. Many developers are surprised to learn the ways they can contribute to making OSS better and not all of them demand a lot of time or effort. In this session I will discuss a career I have spent dedicated to developing, managing, evangelizing and supporting OSS projects. I will address and clarify some misconceptions that folks often have about OSS and will discuss ways that all of us can help OSS continue to be successful and a more integral part of our industry. This story will help those who are interested in being more involved in OSS and aren’t sure where the entry points are.\nAbout The Presenter Jeff Scott Brown is a co-founder of the Grails Foundation and Micronaut Foundation, and a Distinguished Engineer at Object Computing Inc, an organization committed to advocating for open source for more than 30 years.\nAgenda: 5:30-6:15 pm Meet, greet \u0026amp; eat! 6:15-6:20 pm Java News 6:20pm Main presentation\nAfter presentation - social hour: Austins Bar \u0026amp; Grill | South Olathe 2103 E 151st St #2969, Olathe, KS 66062\nLearn more Feedback Since we\u0026rsquo;re always looking for feedback, take a few minutes and let us know what you think!\nCan the schedule better accomodate you?
